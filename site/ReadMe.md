## Setup

Setup (bin\Setup.exe) is fairly simple and the tool will index your drives for common game folders used by many delivery providers.

Use the "SRC" button to add a folder/s where games have been installed. EG: C:\Games, or C:\Program Files

Use the "OUT" button to set the location for the shortcuts.

The "GPD" button will set the location where profile folders for each game will be kept.

Right-Click on the buttons in the setup tool to download supported executables.

## Launching Games

It is not necessary, but best if RJ_LinkRunner.exe, antimicro.exe and xpadder.exe are assigned to run as the administrator.

During gameplay you may create additional joystick profiles and any found within the game's jacket will be saved and reloaded for player 2/3/4, prioritizing the default profile-name eg: "Game Jacket".gamecontroller.amgp, and other "player#" monikers.)

I've tested this on a variety of preconfigurations with a few hundred games and found that 99% of them are identified & launched properly without any adjustment whatsoever.
