This is a very simple program which will find all your game-executables (or shortcuts [game.lnk]) and create shortcuts for them using a launcher which can:
1: use a custom monitor setup
2: use a custom keyboard mapper
3: launch other programs before and after.

Setup is fairly simple.
Use the "SRC" button to add a folder/s where games have been installed.  EG: C:\Games, or C:\Program Files
Use the "OUT" button to set the location for the shortcuts.
The "GPD" button will set the location where profile folders for each game will be kept.

Common Keyboard Mappings are setup for the XBOX-One layout and have presets which do a few things:
The profile for player 1 and player 2 have the ability to reset and end games as well as control the desktop.
